1. **Clone the Repository**

   git clone https://github.com/Anusri30/niti-construction.git
   
   cd niti-construction

2. Upload files to your AWS EC2 using SCP or clone repo directly into EC2.
   
   Ensure Apache, PHP, and MySQL are installed and configured.

3. **Move Project to Web Directory**
   
   sudo mv * /var/www/html/

4. **Set File Permissions**

5. **Configure Apache (if needed)**

   Ensure Apache is serving /var/www/html and restart:
   
   sudo systemctl restart apache2

6. **Create the MySQL Database**
   
   Log in to MySQL and run:
   
   CREATE DATABASE niti_construction CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;
   
   CREATE USER 'niti_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'password123';
   
   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON niti_construction.* TO 'niti_user'@'localhost';
   
   FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
   
7. **Import Tables**
   
    Import your daily_logs, users, and projects tables using:
   
    mysql -u niti_user -p niti_construction < db/schema.sql


üß™ Usage
Navigate to your EC2 public IP in a browser.

Register as a Site Engineer, Chief Engineer, or Client.

Log in and access role-specific dashboards:

Site Engineers submit logs (project.php).

Chief Engineers view all project logs.

Clients see their daily progress summaries.

üèõÔ∏è Architecture Overview:

![alt text](ARCHITECTURE.jpg)

üåç Deployment on AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux)

The NITI Construction platform is deployed on an AWS EC2 instance running Amazon Linux 2023. The following components were configured for a production-ready environment:

üîß EC2 Instance Configuration

OS: Amazon Linux 2023 (AMI)

Instance Type: t2.micro (or as needed)

Security Groups: Configured to allow inbound access on ports:

80 (HTTP)

22 (SSH)

Elastic IP: Attached for consistent public access.

üõ†Ô∏è Software Stack Setup:
 
 1.Install Apache:
 
 sudo yum update -y
 
 sudo yum install httpd -y
 
 sudo systemctl enable httpd
 
 sudo systemctl start httpd

2.Install PHP and MySQL:

 sudo amazon-linux-extras enable php8.2
 
 sudo yum clean metadata
 
 sudo yum install php php-mysqli php-cli php-common php-pdo -y

3.Install MariaDB Server (MySQL-Compatible):

 sudo yum install mariadb105-server -y
 
 sudo systemctl start mariadb
 
 sudo systemctl enable mariadb

4.Install phpMyAdmin (Optional)

Configure Apache to serve phpMyAdmin (requires additional setup).

5.üìÇ Deploy Your Application

SSH into your EC2 instance and clone the repository:

 git clone https://github.com/yourusername/niti-construction.git
 
 cd niti-construction 
 
 sudo cp -r * /var/www/html/
 
 sudo systemctl restart httpd

6.git clone https://github.com/yourusername/niti-construction.git

 cd niti-construction
 
 sudo cp -r * /var/www/html/
 
 sudo systemctl restart httpd

üîí Permissions and Security

Ensure proper permissions:

sudo chown -R apache:apache /var/www/html/

sudo chmod -R 755 /var/www/html/

Configure .env or database credentials securely in your PHP code.

üåê Access Your Application

Open your browser and go to:

üåê Access Your Application

Open your browser and go to:

http://34.230.91.24/
http://<your-ec2-public-ip>/

‚òÅÔ∏è OpenWeather API Integration:

The platform integrates the OpenWeather API to fetch real-time weather data for project sites. This enhances situational awareness for engineers and clients during daily log submissions.

Usage

API Key is securely stored in a configuration file.

Data such as temperature, humidity, and weather conditions is displayed on the dashboard.

You can replace the demo key in weather.php with your own API key.
